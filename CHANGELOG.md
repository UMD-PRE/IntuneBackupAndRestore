## [5.1.0] - 2025-12-05

- Fixed `Invoke-IntuneRestoreDeviceEnrollmentConfiguration` to correctly include `deviceEnrollmentConfigurationType` property.
- Fixed `Invoke-IntuneRestoreDeviceEnrollmentConfiguration` to add [int] casting for priority values to prevent type conversion errors.
- Fixed `Invoke-IntuneRestoreNotificationTemplate` to use two-step process: create template first, then add localized messages separately.
- Fixed `Invoke-IntuneRestoreNotificationTemplate` to remove `defaultLocale` and `description` properties during creation (causes BadRequest errors).
- Fixed `Invoke-IntuneRestoreConditionalAccessPolicy` and `Invoke-IntuneRestoreNamedLocation` to use Beta API and require Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess scope.
- Fixed scope validation in `Start-IntuneBackup` and `Start-IntuneRestoreConfig` to include all 8 required scopes including Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess.
- Added comprehensive verbose logging throughout restore functions for debugging.
- Updated `Start-IntuneBackup` scope validation from 4 scopes to 8 scopes (added DeviceManagementScripts, Policy.Read.All, Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess).
- Updated `Start-IntuneRestoreConfig` scope validation to match backup requirements.
- Improved error handling to continue restore operations even when individual policy types fail.

## [3.1.0] - 2021-08-12
- Microsoft has started to encrypt Custom OMA-URI values in Device Configuration profiles. Because encrypted values are now stored in newer backups, restoration fails. This update decrypts those values prior to backing up the profile, enabling restoration again.
